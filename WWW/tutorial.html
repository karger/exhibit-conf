      <h1>Exhibit Tutorial</h1> 
 
<p>This is an editing tool for <b>Exhibits</b>.  Exhibits are
pages that present a collections of items, with interactive elements
such as facets for sorting and filtering the collection, and multiple
types of visualizations such as lists, thumbnail grids, and timelines.

<p>There are three important parts of an exhibit.  <b>Views</b>
present collections of items.  <b>Facets</b> are widgets that
filter the collection of items presented in a view.
And <b>Lenses</b> are templates that describe how individual
items should be presentedemdash;which properties of the item should
be shown, with what layout and formatting.  There's one more common
optional element: a <b>view panel</b> that can hold multiple
view among which the reader can switch to see one at a time.

<p>As an example, this page shows a collection of MIT nobel prize
winners.  You are looking at a view panel that offers two views; the
currently-presented <b>Tile</b> view that lists items vertically
and a <b>Thumbnail</b> that lays out items in a grid (often used
for photographs).  You can switch between views by clicking on the
view titles above the view.

<p>On the right side is a <b>list facet</b> for filtering the winners
according to their year of winning.  You can use this facet to select
multiple values, and the view will update accordingly.

<p>Each nobelist is presented using a <b>lens</b> that lays out
certain properties: the nobelists' name, their discipline and year of
winning, and a photograph.

<p>Below the visualization, you will find instructions on how to edit
the exhibit.  You can also just select File&gt;New to discard this
tutorial exhibit and start with a blank slate.

<h2>Editing the Exhibit</h2>
<p>You can edit everything you see, using the menu bar you see above.
  As a simplest example, you can edit this text: just select
  Edit&gt;Page in the menu.  Then you can click anywhere in this text
  and type.  Clicking will also cause a floating menu to appear; you
  can use this to insert images and links, or to select and change
  text formatting.

<p>If, while editing the page, you hover over one of the the exhibit
  elements (views or facets), it will highlight, and two buttons
  will appear in the top right to let you edit or delete that element.
  Clicking the edit button will open a dialog box that lets you change
  the widget's configuration.  You can use the editor to change the
  type of view or facet&mdash;for example, you can switch the
  nobel-year facet to a "Cloud" facet that displays the values
  differently.  Delete does the obvious thing.

<p>If instead of editing you want to insert a brand new widget, click
  your cursor on the page to select the spot where you want to insert
  it, then use the Insert menu item at the top.  To insert an
  additional view in the view panel, click the view panel's edit
  button; it will let you add a view.

<p>Besides editing the widgets, you can edit the way an individual
  item is presented.  If you select Edit&gt;Lenses, a small box will
  appear containing the template.  You edit it the same way you edit
  the page; a preview of how items will look appears directly below.

<p>Besides editing the static "boilerplate" of the lens, an important
  step in editing lenses is adding placeholders for content from the
  individual items being displayed.  You do so using the Insert menu
  while the lens editor is active.  You will have the option of
  inserting text (a text content placeholder that is filled in by a
  property you specify from the data), an image (you specify a
  property holding an image url) or a link (you specify a property
  holding a url that will become the anchor of the link).

<p>In addition to editing the visualization, you can edit the data
  being visualized.  Exhibit fetches its data according to a url
  specified in the page; Click Edit&gt;Data Links to select a
  different url for the data source.

<p>Once you are satisfied with the presentation, you can save it.  Use
  File&gt;Save As to download a copy of the Exhibit you created.  You
  can save this html document anywhere; opening it in a web browser
  will activate the interactive exhibit.  Note that due to browser
  security restrictions, the name of the downloaded URL will be
  gibberish; you'll need to pick a reasonable name.  

<p>You can also edit the data you see.  Click Edit&gt;Data and the
  data you see will become editable: click on the data item and you
  can change it by typing over it.  Right now this editing is for
  demonstration only; there is no mechanism provided to save the data
  you have edited.
